DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.
Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.
1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.
Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a bug report.
If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL dick. How to cite a repo. Alternatively, even just a comment giving attribution to where you found the code would be OK.
